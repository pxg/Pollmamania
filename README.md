# add a contact form page (different app)

# let the user suggest a poll option if one isn't present
# validate poll options
# let the admin see suggested poll options and approve/delete them

# soft delete on polls
# let user create a poll in a poll daddy style
# let user upload an image

# add a date to show polls currently open, add a poll archive feature
# output the poll list as xml and json
# output the poll results as xml and json

# add an Ajax form for voting in polls (web service)
